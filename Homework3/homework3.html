    <h1>Homework 3 - Projections</h1>
    <h2>Molly Grand</h2>
    
    <h3>Description of Assignment: </h3>
    <p>In order to change the projection model used in each display, I changed the projection using the icon in the bottom right corner in QGIS, and used the Indicatrix Matrix to view how each projection distorted the maps. </p>

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <p>WGS84 uses a conformal projection, and while it preserves direction and the shape of the map, it distorts distance and area. From the circles generated from the Indicatrix Matrix, we can see that this projection especially distorts the distance and area in the poles.</p>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <p>The Aitoff Projection somewhat distorts shapes, areas, distances, directions, and angles. This can be seen by the shapes of the circles all throughout the map, that appear to be stretched in certain areas (especially towards the outer edges of the map).</p>

    </a>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator</h2>
    <p>The Pseudo Mercator Projection distorts the relative size of the area of landmasses. Since this projection especially exaggerates areas that are far from the equator, we can see that Greenland appears to be the same size as Africa.</p>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
    <p>This projection is not distorted along the equator, but distortion increases towards the poles. This projection extremely distorts the shape of landmasses, and this can be seen by the stretched out circles at the top and bottom of the map.</p>

    </a>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <p>The World Equidistant Conic projection preserves distances along all meridians and two standard parallels. However, shapes, areas, distances, directions, and angles are all generally distorted throughout the entire map. The distance at the bottom of the image appears to suffer the most from distortion.</p>

    </a>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <p>The North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection preserves both distance and direction. Shape and area appear to be distorted throughout the entire map and this distortion appears to incease outward from the center point.</p>

    </a>

    <h2>Winkel Tripel</h2>
    <p>While the Winkel Tripel projection generally distorts shapes, areas, distances, directions, and angles, it maintains a nice balance between size and shape projection throughout the map. </p>
