<p>The map that I created is a chloropleth map of the NC Covid-19 Death Rate by County. I calculated the death rate by doing the deaths
    per county divided by the total Covid-19 cases per county. I then mapped this data using the natural breaks classification method for 
    a chloropleth map. I chose to map the Covid-19 Death Rate in North Carolina because I took a class last semester where I mapped the 
    Covid-19 Death Rate in New York, and I wanted to compare how varied this death rate was throughout the counties in each state.
