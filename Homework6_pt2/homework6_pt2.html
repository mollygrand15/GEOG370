<h1>Homework 6 Part 2: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
<h2>Molly Grand</h2>
<h3>Ratio - The ratio that I calculated and used in the three maps is the number of high school graduates (ages 18-24) divided by 
    the total population ages 18 to 24 years. I calculated this ratio because I wanted to show the distribution of the percent of 
    high school graduates ages 18 to 24 in each county of NY state.

<h3>Equal Interval Map</h3>

<p>The Equal Interval classification method divides the range of attribute values into equally
        sized classes. The advantages of this method are that the legend is easy to interpret and this map is 
    suitable for presenting the data to a non-technical audience. The disadvantages of this method are that certain 
    datasets will end up with most of the data values falling into only one or two classes, while few to no values will 
    occupy the other classes.

<h3>Quantile</h3>

    </a>
<p>The Quantile classification method places equal numbers of observations into each class. 
        The main advantage of this method is that it is good at emphasizing the relative position of 
        the data values. A disadvantage of this method is that features placed within the same 
        class can have widely differing values, especially if the data is not evenly distributed across
        its range. 
</p>

<h3>Natural Breaks</h3>

    </a>
<p>The Natural Breaks classification method utilizes an algorithm to group values into classes that 
    are separated by distinct break points. The advantage of this method is that it idenfities real classes/
    clusters within the data and gives an accurate representation of trends. Some disadvantages of this method are
    that classes can contain widely varying number ranges and that it can be difficult to compare two or more
    maps with natural breaks classifications because the class ranges are so specific to each dataset.
