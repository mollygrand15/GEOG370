<h1>Homework 6 Part 2: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
<h2>Molly Grand</h2>
<h3>Ratio - The ratio that I calculated and used in the three maps is the Black population high school graduate or higher to the
    total Black population. I wanted to map this ratio to see the distribution of education attainment among the Black population 
    throughout NY state.

<h3>Equal Interval Map</h3>

    </a>
<p>The Equal Interval classification method divides the range of attribute values into equally
    sized classes. The advantages of this method are that the legend is easy to interpret and this map is 
    suitable for presenting the data to a non-technical audience. The disadvantages of this method are that certain 
    datasets will end up with most of the data values falling into only one or two classes, while few to no values will 
    occupy the other classes.

<h3>Quantile Map</h3>

    </a>
<p>The Quantile classification method places equal numbers of observations into each class. 
        The main advantage of this method is that it is good at emphasizing the relative position of 
        the data values. It is also good for comparing the medians of data values. A disadvantage of this method is that features placed within the same 
        class can have widely differing values, especially if the data is not evenly distributed across
        its range. Additionally, this method makes it difficult to see clusters in the data.
</p>

<h3>Natural Breaks Map</h3>

    </a>
<p>The Natural Breaks classification method utilizes an algorithm to group values into classes that 
    are separated by distinct break points. The advantage of this method is that it idenfities real classes/
    clusters within the data and gives an accurate representation of trends. Some disadvantages of this method are
    that classes can contain widely varying number ranges and that it can be difficult to compare two or more
    maps with natural breaks classifications because the class ranges are so specific to each dataset.
