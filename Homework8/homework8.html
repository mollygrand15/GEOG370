<h3>Research Question - How many nursing homes in North Carolina are within 5 miles of a hospital? </h3>

<h2>Map</h2>
<a href="HW8_MAP.png">
    <img src="HW8_MAP.png" alt="Map of Nursing Homes in NC Within 5 Miles of a Hospital" width='500px'>
    </a>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>To create this map, I used both the buffer and intersect methods. I first found a polygon of the hospitals in North Carolina and exported it to a 2264 projection. I then uploaded
    that file and created a 5 mile buffer aroud all of the points. Once I created my new buffered polygon of hospitals, I added a vector of the nursing homes in North Carolina and exported 
    it to a 2264 projection. I then used the intersect tool to find the nursing homes that fell within the 5-mile hospital buffer. I then created my final map using only
    that intersected layer.
