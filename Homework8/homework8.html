<h3>Research Question - How many nursing homes in North Carolina are within 5 miles of a hospital? </h3>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>To create this map, I used both the buffer and intersect methods. I first found a polygon of the hospitals in North Carolina and exported it to a 2264 projection. I then uploaded
    that file and created a 5 mile buffer aroud all of the hospital points. Once I created my new buffered layer of hospitals, I added a vector of the nursing homes in North Carolina and exported 
    it to a 2264 projection. I then used the intersect tool to find the nursing homes that fell within the 5-mile hospital buffer. Lastly, I created my final map using only the intersected layer.
